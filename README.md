* In game seed generation with configurable parameters

Upcoming:

* World Tour
* Forlorn escape plant clues
* Sharable seeds

## FAQ

### Why write another randomiser?

* To separate out QoL and accessibility features into different mods, allowing you to play with them without it being rando
* For a better developer workflow
* To make it compatible with other mods

### Where is the spoiler/seed file?

Go to the save file in the main menu and press the indicated button (default `Tab`/`Back`)

These files are lost when updating the mod or overwriting a save slot, so be sure to make a copy of any you want to keep.

### Sein text is back!

You need the [QoL mod](https://github.com/Kirefel/OriDeQol)
